## Stata Programs
### **recocl** - Recodes municipality's codes for Chile (CL)

Chile has changed his municipal code a couple of times. Currently, not all databases have the most current municipality code, therefore it is necessary to carry out a recoding of the municipality code for some municipalities in region I (Arica y Parinacota), VIII (Bio-Bio) and X (Los RÃ­os). This is exactly what recocl does.

**Note:** Install in Stata typing _ssc install recocl_.

### **grvar** - Apply a non-constant growth rate to a variable

Calculate the future values of a variable from the initial value and a non-constant growth/decrease rate (e.g. inflation). It is useful when we want to fit a variable with a growth rate in a time serie or panel data.
