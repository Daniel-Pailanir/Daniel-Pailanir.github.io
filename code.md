#### **recocl** - Recodes municipality's codes for Chile (CL)

Chile has changed his municipal code a couple of times. Currently, not all databases have the most current municipality code, therefore it is necessary to carry out a recoding of the municipality code for some municipalities in region I (Arica y Parinacota), VIII (Bio-Bio) and X (Los RÃ­os). This is exactly what recocl does.
