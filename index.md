I am a Economist from [University of Santiago of Chile](https://www.usach.cl/) and I am currently studying a MA in Economics at [University of Chile](https://www.postgradouchile.cl/programa/magister/magister-en-economia/). I love work with data and my fields of interest are **Macroeconomics** and **Public Policy**.

You can find my [CV here](../pdf/DanielPailanir-cv.pdf).
